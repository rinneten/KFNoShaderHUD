# KFNoShaderHUD
Works on any server, it's not a mutator, it's client-sided texture patch.
## This simple texture client-sided patch removes:
- spectator menu film effect
- low hp red shader
- sepia shader (on any map)
- bloat vomit
## Do not removes: 
- any fire textures (however, [mutator](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2446866397) removes them optionally, but i decided to keep them)
- any smoke effects ([here is another patch that removes smoke](https://github.com/rinneten/KFNoSmokePatch))
# Install
1. [Download repos as .zip](https://github.com/rinneten/KFNoShaderHUD/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)
2. Extract 3 .utx files from \Textures\ to your Textures KF folder (..\Steam\steamapps\common\KillingFloor\Textures\)
# If something went wrong
There are also original .utx textures, if you want to go back, feel free to download them.
