# KFNoShaderHUD
## This simple texture client-sided patch removes:
- spectator menu film effect
- low hp red shader
- sepia shader (on every map)
- bloat vomit
## Do not removes: 
- any fire textures (however, mutator removes them optionally, but i decided to keep them)
- any smoke effects [(here is another patch that removes smoke)](https://github.com/rinneten/KFNoSmokePatch)
# Install
1. [Download repos as .zip](https://github.com/rinneten/KFNoShaderHUD.git)
